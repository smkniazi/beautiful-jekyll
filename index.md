I am PhD candidate at [Royal Institute of Technology](http://www.kth.se">KTH</a>), Sweden. Currently I am working at [Swedish Institute of Computer Science](http://www.sics.se) Research Lab. My research intrests are distributed storage systems and cloud computing.

Before joining SICS/KTH, I worked as lecturer at [National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences](http://nu.edu.pk"); and as Systems Software Engineer at [Streaming Networks](http://www.streaming-networks.com").

## Projects

#### HopsFS
HopsFS is a next-generation distribution of Apache Hadoop File System, that delivers a quantum leap in both the cluster-size and throughput compared to Hadoop clusters. HopsFS delivers over 16 times the throughput of the Hadoop Filesystem (HDFS) for a real-world Hadoop workload from Spotify. HopsFS’ key innovation is a novel distributed architecture for managing Hadoop’s metadata in MySQL Cluster, Oracle’s open-source NewSQL database.
